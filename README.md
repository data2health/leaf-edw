### Open Source Clinical Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) Data Browser (Leaf)

Academic medical centers and health systems are increasingly challenged with supporting appropriate secondary uses of data from a multitude of sources. To that end, the UW Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) has emerged as a central port for all data that can include clinical, research, administrative, financial and other data types. Although EDWâ€™s have been popular and successful in providing a single stop for data, they are often non-self service and require an informatician or clinical informatics expert to access. 

To address this challenge, we have developed an easy to use, self service web-based tool for querying, browsing and extracting clinical cohorts from the UW Medicine EDW, called Leaf.  Leaf enables querying by data dictionaries or ontologies and allows both de-identified and identified access to patient data and grants access to these datasets in a compliant manner. While Leaf provides basic visualizations, it contains robust tools for exporting directly to REDCap projects. The users of Leaf include both quality improvement and research investigators and has been developed using an Agile development process with a soft production rollout to identify and address software, support and data quality concerns.
