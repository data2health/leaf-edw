# Research Design
Academic medical centers and health systems are increasingly challenged with supporting appropriate secondary uses of data from a multitude of sources. To that end, the UW Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) has emerged as a central port for all data that can include clinical, research, administrative, financial and other data types. Although EDWâ€™s have been popular and successful in providing a single stop for data, they are often non-self service and require an informatician or clinical informatics expert to access. 

To address this challenge, we have developed an easy to use, self service web-based tool for querying, browsing and extracting clinical cohorts from the UW Medicine EDW, called Leaf.  Leaf enables querying by data dictionaries or ontologies and allows both de-identified and identified access to patient data and grants access to these datasets in a compliant manner. While Leaf provides basic visualizations, it contains robust tools for exporting directly to REDCap projects. 

# Methodology
Engagement Phase. We would like to engage the CTSA community to pilot Leaf a their institution to help mature the tool further. Interest is gained via multiple avenues; posting of Leaf code to GitHub, personalized/scheduled demos, the creation of a YouTube video and simple word of mouth. 

Pilot Phase. Leaf has been developed using an Agile development process to ensure user interface and features were driven by the needs of clinicians and researchers. Using this same methodology we will like to foster further advancement of Leaf by engaging several CTSA hubs to pilot Leaf at their institution. UW developers will work closely with resources at CTSA hubs to implement Leaf, file bugs, features and collaborate via GitHub. Our selection process is based upon the infrastructure of an institution, collaboration of features/UI and the number of Leaf instances (multi. vs. single).

Open Source and Documentation Phase. Release of Leaf code under an open source license, and the documentation of deployment and administration of Leaf. Developers work diligently to clean the source code and develop extensive documentation on GitHub; architecture, installation steps, configuration on data models, and networking with multiple Leaf instances. A manuscript will also be submitted to JAMIA that outlines various features, concepts, methods, and architecture.

Evaluation Phase. Leaf will be evaluated at pilot institutions  to determine its viability for independent and user friendly  deployment. This will be conducted via a number of feedback activites; conduct focus groups, develop analysis report, and conduct surveys. The project manager will work closely with resources as pilot site during this phase.

# Expected Outcomes
1. Leaf Code on GitHub under an open source license. 
2. 3-4 successfully run pilots
3. Evaluation Paper and Manuscript Paper
4. GitHub repository that successfully allows Leaf to be deployed completely independent of any support, troubleshooting, etc. for the CTSA community. 

# Deliverables

- Pilot Plan Framework. For each pilot site a collaborative document will be created with the Leaf team that outlines purpose and goals, scope, timeline, communication plan and feedback actitivies. We will achieve this by having bi-weekly chats with project management team and quartly chats with executive team. This deliverable supports the Leaf team and pilot site, enabling both to have a clear understanding, minimizing risk.

- Open Source licensed Leaf code. Clean and polished code available on GitHub with extensive documentation for deployment. This will be accomplished through expertise gained through the deployment of Leaf on the UW infrastructure. A well organized/define repository supports the independent deployment of Leaf at a CTSA site.

- Evaluation Pilot paper. This paper will discuss and outline the accomplishments of implementing Leaf at 2-3 CTSA hubs. This paper will serve as an information source for institutions to deploy Leaf independently at their site and serves as a companion to the repository. 

- Leaf manuscript. This paper serves the purpose of gaining traction in the community and also serves as a way to educate the community on Leaf.

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
  
  Since this project is heavily influenced by the engagement activities of a CTSA hub, there is potential for lack of involvement; lack of adequate resources to work with the Leaf team; tech or timeline issues; and/or Leaf is deemed not useful for site. We have devised a strategy that includes having several potential pilot sites that can serve as a back-up sites in case any of the above scenerios occur. Each committed pilot site will be evaluated at period intervals to determine their engangement/progress.
  
# Y3 (July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020) Accomplishments 
The following content is from the June 30 - Dec 30, 2019 mid year progress report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLe3uCfEUakWxIJyi5SA4ZocYDmINvhySTperaui1Bw/edit).  Please add progress for Jan 1 - June 30th, 2020. 

* Pilot Plan Framework. For each pilot site a collaborative document will be created with the Leaf team that outlines the purpose and goals, scope, timeline, communication plan and feedback activities. We will achieve this by having bi-weekly chats with project management team and quarterly chats with executive team. This deliverable supports the Leaf team and pilot site, enabling both to have a clear understanding, minimizing risk.
  * Pilot plan documents are tracked in this GitHub issue https://github.com/data2health/leaf-edw/issues/12. The issue links the Johns Hopkins pilot plan, and will include the University of Chicago and Case Western as they progress in their deployment

* Open Source licensed Leaf code. Clean and polished code available on GitHub with extensive documentation for deployment. This will be accomplished through expertise gained through the deployment of Leaf on the UW infrastructure. A well organized/defined repository supports the independent deployment of Leaf at a CTSA site.
  * The Mozilla Public License v2 was added in March 2019. Extensive deployment documentation, examples, code snippets, and embedded videos are available directly on the GitHub Leaf page (see https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#architecture, https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps, and https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/admin/concept/README.md#the-building-blocks-of-leaf-concepts as starting points).

* Evaluation Pilot paper. This paper will discuss and outline the accomplishments of implementing Leaf at 2-3 CTSA hubs. This paper will serve as an information source for institutions to deploy Leaf independently at their site and serves as a companion to the repository.
  * We are actively planning this but need to coordinate with our partner pilot sites, as they are only beginning to open the tool up to users and this will take time (est. ~6 months).

* Leaf manuscript. This paper serves the purpose of gaining traction in the community and also serves as a way to educate the community on Leaf.
  * Successfully [published in JAMIA in October 2019](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/27/1/109/5583724).
