# Research Design
Academic medical centers and health systems are increasingly challenged with supporting appropriate secondary uses of data from a multitude of sources. To that end, the UW Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) has emerged as a central port for all data that can include clinical, research, administrative, financial and other data types. Although EDWâ€™s have been popular and successful in providing a single stop for data, they are often non-self service and require an informatician or clinical informatics expert to access. 

To address this challenge, we have developed an easy to use, self service web-based tool for querying, browsing and extracting clinical cohorts from the UW Medicine EDW, called Leaf.  Leaf enables querying by data dictionaries or ontologies and allows both de-identified and identified access to patient data and grants access to these datasets in a compliant manner. While Leaf provides basic visualizations, it contains robust tools for exporting directly to REDCap projects. 

# Methodology
Engagement Phase. We would like to engage the CTSA community to pilot Leaf a their institution to help mature the tool further. Interest is gained via multiple avenues; posting of Leaf code to GitHub, personalized/scheduled demos, the creation of a YouTube video and simple word of mouth. 

Pilot Phase. Leaf has been developed using an Agile development process to ensure user interface and features were driven by the needs of clinicians and researchers. Using this same methodology we will like to foster further advancement of Leaf by engaging several CTSA hubs to pilot Leaf at their institution. UW developers will work closely with resources at CTSA hubs to implement Leaf, file bugs, features and collaborate via GitHub. Our selection process is based upon the infrastruture of an insitution, collaboration of code the to the Repo and the number of Leaf instances created.

Open Source and Documentation Phase. Release of Leaf code under an open source license, and the documentation of deployment and administration of Leaf. Developers work diligently to clean the source code and develop extensive documentation on GitHub; architecture, installation steps, configuration on data models, and networking with multiple Leaf instances. A manuscript will also be submitted to JAMIA that outlines various features, concepts, methods, and architecture.

Evaluation Phase. Leaf will be evaluated at pilot institutions  to determine its viability for independent and user friendly  deployment. This will be conducted via a number of feedback activites; conduct focus groups, develop analysis report, and conduct surveys. The project manager will work closely with resources as pilot site during this phase.

# Expected Outcomes
1. Leaf Code on GitHub under an open source license. 
2. 3-4 successfully run pilots
3. Evaluation Paper and Manuscript Paper
4. GitHub repository that successfully allows Leaf to completely independent of any support, troubleshooting, etc. for the CTSA community to deploy and use.

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
  
  Since this project is heavily influenced by the engagement activities of CTSA hub,
