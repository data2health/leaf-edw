**Leaf Education**

- Our plan is to have training videos produced for the community to watch independently of any Leaf team interaction.
- A well documented GitHub repository that includes varies educational files that help medium experienced developers successfully deploy Leaf at their institution. 
- Best practices guide; how to use Leaf to effectively and efficiently identify a cohort opportunity. How can Leaf help a researcher validate their research question, or know what questions are viable?
