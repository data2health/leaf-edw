**Evaluation Plan**

The usefulness and evaluation of the Leaf tool will be analyzed by piloting Leaf 2-3 CTSA hubs. 
We will measure:
- The deployment of Leaf on pilot site archectiture (speed, ease, documentation, etc.)
- The resources at the pilot site (tech and personnel requirements)
- Evaluate Pilot Plan for usability
- GitHub Leaf Repo (Documentation)
- User feedback (survey users on several metrics)

Will measure success based upon:
- How many times repo is 'forked' and deployed at site(s) independently
- How many new users exist outside of the UW
- How many pilots are successfully executed
