**Engagement Plan**

We would like to engage several sites in the community to deploy, use and analyze Leaf's functionality. We plan to do so by: 

- Completing multiple demos to gather interest
- The pilots themselves will require a high level of engagement from CTSA hubs; we plan on having at least one pilot occur outside of the CD2H community. 
- Submit a AMIA workshop proposal
